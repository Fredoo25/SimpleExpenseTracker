# SimpleExpenseTracker
Hello! This is a simple project I worked on this year which acts as a simple expense tracker. The options include adding an expense and clearing a list of expenses for the webpage. In the backend, Java and SpringBoot is used to create a web-service with the use of Spring tools and Java classes. An expense is created with its description, amount, and date. <br/>
Here is what the webpage looks like:

Here is what is displayed when all expenses are cleared:
